        "\n",
        "A [`torch.Tensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html) object is very similar to a `numpy.array`, and most existing operations in numpy have identical equivalent in PyTorch. However behaviors can be slightly different so always check the documentation ! Using built-in PyTorch functions instead of numpy enables automatic gradient computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that PyTorch operations are built to be significantly accelerated on GPU by using parallel computing. This implies that the first dimension of a `torch.Tensor` is most often interpreted as the batch dimension and operations are applied *in parallel* to each element of the batch **independently**.\n",
        "For instance, given a tensor `A` of size `[M,N]` and a tensor `X` of size `[B,N,P]`, the output of `A @ X` will be of size `[B,M,P]`, where the matrix multiplication by `A` is applied to each of the `X[i]` in parallel.\n",

        "In DiffusionNet, some blocks (*eg* the diffusion block) can be applied to multiple surfaces in parallel so batches are made of surfaces.
