# Geometry Processing and Geometric Deep Learning

## Lecturers:

- [Etienne Corman](https://members.loria.fr/ECorman/) (junior CNRS researcher, LORIA)
- [Julie Digne](https://liris.cnrs.fr/julie.digne/) (senior CNRS researcher, LIRIS)
- [Maks Ovsjanikov](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~maks/) (Professor at Ecole Polytechnique, LIX)

## Goals of the course

 This course will introduce students to advanced topics in modern geometric data analysis (the field known as Geometry Processing) with focus on: 
a) mathematical foundations (discrete differential geometry, mapping, optimization), and 
b) deep learning for best performing methods. 


We will give an overview of the foundations in surface-based analysis and processing before moving to modern techniques based on deep learning for solving problems such as 3D shape classification, correspondence, parametrization, etc. Finally, we will cover recent approaches for generating geometry, from both the mesh and shape-based perspectives.
